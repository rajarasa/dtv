								<p>YourPreferredTVDealer is a collection of brands and digital platforms (such as mobile and/or TV applications) that link people with information to aid in making some of life's most crucial decisions (including "us," "we," or "our"). Allconnect, Bankrate, CNET, MYMove, BestColleges, LonelyPlanet, and The Points Guy are just a few of the brands owned by Red Ventures. The websites, apps, and products made available by Red Ventures will collectively be referred to as the "Services" for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. You should examine each service's unique rule prior to using it, as certain Red Ventures services offer distinct rules regarding privacy (like our services in Brazil or Joint Ventures).

								<p>The categories of Personal Information that we may gather for our services are described in this Privacy Policy.
								</p>

								<!-- Small Title -->
								<h5 class="s-24 w-700">Additional Disclosures.</h5>

								<!-- Text -->
								<p>In response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, in accordance with any legal process, or to comply with applicable laws, we may share your private data with law enforcement and other government officials.

For further details on your privacy choices, see the Manage Your Information part of this Policy.
								</p>

								<!-- Small Title -->

								<h4 class="s-24 w-700">Area Information</h4> 

								<p>We may ask for your consent to collect your location data when you use some of our services. Some aspects of our Services (such location-based offers) might require confirmation of your location in order to work, therefore if you choose not to share your location data, those services won't be available to you. The device you're using and the way you're connected to the Internet can both affect how precise the location data is. We may periodically gather location data when you use or leave open our Services if you activate location services for them. You might be able to control whether location data is used by our Applications depending on the platform you use to access them (such as Apple's iOS or Google's Android).</p>


								<h4 class="s-24 w-700">in general, cookies</h4> 

								<p>As a result of your use of the Services, we, our service providers working on our behalf, and other companies gathering information on our pages may automatically collect or receive certain information about you and/or your device(s) using device-based tracking technologies like cookies, pixels, tags, beacons, scripts, or other technology.

Geolocation data, such as (a) information identifying the specific location of your mobile device (when you agree to let an app or service collect this) and (b) your IP address, which may be used to determine your approximative position, may be included in the information we collect. We make use of this data.</p>

								<h4 class="s-24 w-700">Tracking across devices</h4>

								<p>When users engage with websites and services that are not linked with us but use our technologies, such as cookies and other tracking tools, we and our service providers may gather and retain information about their activities. This enables us to connect those browsers and devices into a device graph, for example, and infer the existence of a similar user or household behind a number of different devices or browsers. In order to enable people to utilise our services on one device and seamlessly continue where they left off on another device, we have a business need to understand how customers use our sites across devices.Additionally, we have a commercial requirement to deliver tailored advertising on each device, which is implied by the browsing patterns on the devices.</p>

We might get both individual and collective reports on how these technologies are used. After using our products on one website, these analytics services, including third-party services like Google Analytics, use this information to display advertisements for our products on other websites you visit. These ads might be based on things you do while using the site, like the sites you visit and what you do there.

We use the information we have to improve our advertising systems so we can show you relevant interest-based advertising, measure the effectiveness and reach of advertisements and services, verify delivery and track performance of an advertising campaign, and ensure that an ad is only delivered when a real person is visiting the site and that the same users don’t see the same ads too frequently. You may update your preferences regarding personalised advertising by visiting the Cookie Settings link in the footer of each site to manage your settings.</p>

								<p>To verify your entry into and eligibility to participate in contests, giveaways, or sweepstakes and inform you if you’ve won. If your entry information will be used for any other purposes, we will disclose that in the applicable rules governing that contest, giveaway, or sweepstakes.</p>

								<p>To monitor, improve, and conduct analytics on our Services and advertiser product offerings.</p>

								<p>For internal administrative purposes, such as the safety and security of our Services, and to manage our relationships.</p>

								<p>To permit you to participate in social sharing, including live social media feeds, and to implement Social Features you choose to use.</p>

								<p>The Apps in our Services may request to send you push notifications from time to time to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. The Apps may also ask for your permission to access your camera and your photos. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, or if you've initially agreed for the application to access your camera and photos and you would like to stop the application from accessing them, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device, such as the operating system and user identification information.</p>

								<p>To detect security incidents and protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, including attempts to manipulate or violate our policies, procedures, and terms and conditions.</p>

								<p>To comply with legal obligations, to establish or exercise our rights, to defend against a legal claim, and to investigate, prevent, or take appropriate action regarding possible misconduct.</p>

								<p>For such other purposes not described in this Privacy Policy as you may consent (from time to time) and as otherwise permitted by law.</p>

								<p>Although the sections above describe our primary purpose(s) in collecting your information, in many situations we have more than one purpose. For example, if you complete an online purchase, we may collect your information to perform our contract with you, but we also collect your information as we have a business need to maintain your information after your transaction is complete so that we can quickly and easily respond to any questions about your order. As a result, our collection and processing of your information is based in different contexts upon your consent, our need to perform a contract, our obligations under law, and/or our need to conduct our business.</p>

								<h4 class="s-24 w-700">Disclosure Of Information</h4>

								<p>In addition to the specific situations discussed elsewhere in this policy, we may disclose your Personal Information in the following situations:</p>

								<p>Affiliates and Acquisitions We may disclose your Personal Information to our corporate affiliates (e.g., parent company, sister companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control). If another company acquires, or plans to acquire, our company, business, or assets, we will also disclose your Personal Information to that company using appropriate safeguards, including at the negotiation stage.</p>

								<p>Our Business clients When we collect information on behalf of our business clients, we disclose that information to those clients.</p>

								<p>Service Providers. We disclose your information to service providers. Among other things, service providers may help us administer our website, conduct surveys, provide technical support, assist or support our business operations and other administrative functions, process payments, and assist in the fulfilment of orders.</p>

								<p>Partner Promotion. We may offer contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions with third-party partners. If you decide to enter a contest, sweepstakes, or promotion that is sponsored by and/or associated with a third-party partner, then the information that you provide will be disclosed to them. Their use of your information is not governed by this privacy policy.</p>

								<p>Audience Measurement Services. We may disclose your Personal Information to audience measurement companies that help us and other websites measure and understand the audiences that view our content.</p>

								<p>Video Viewing Behaviour Consistent with applicable law, we may disclose your video viewing behaviour to third parties, including advertising companies, analytics partners, and social media sites.</p>

								<p>Aggregated and Anonymous information We may disclose aggregated, anonymous information to any third party. This information is not linked to Personal Information that can identify you or another individual.</p>

								<p>Advertising. We may disclose certain data to Advertising Platforms, including Google, and Social Networks such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Snapchat, to allow us to target existing users and customers with highly relevant advertising campaigns. For the purposes of such campaigns. We may share a unique code (such as a hashed email address) with the applicable Advertising platform for that identifier to be matched against existing users of the relevant Advertising Platform and to identify potentially relevant audiences for targeted advertising. We use services such as Google Ads’ Customer Match, LiveRamp, LinkedIn Matched Audiences, and Facebook Custom Audiences for these purposes. In addition to advertisements for our own goods and services, we may also facilitate third parties to advertise their own goods and services, including by targeting those advertisements to those that might be most interested in them. These advertisements may be shown within our Services. To provide advertisements relevant to you, your IP address may be used, as well as your operating system and device type. Information about your device will be used to show you advertisements that work properly on that device. You may be able to adjust your preferences by visiting our Cookie Policy or below in the 'Your Choices' section of this policy. To opt out of advertising on a person-based level from LiveRamp, please click here.
								Public. Some of our Services may provide the opportunity to post comments or reviews in a public forum. If you decide to submit information about our Services, that information may be publicly available.</p>

								<p>Other Persons or Entities with Your Consent. With appropriate consent when required, certain Services may disclose your Personal Information to third-party marketing partners, and they may contact you by email, telephone, postal mail, or other common communication methods with marketing and promotional messages about their products or services. Sometimes we will give you the option to receive further communications from one of our advertising partners, for example, when we run a competition with that advertiser. When you provide consent to receive communications from that third-party advertiser, your personal information will be managed by that third-party’s privacy policy. In some cases, we may also ask if you would like us to disclose your information to other third parties that are not described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
								Social Features</p>

								<p>Some of our Services may include features that are designed to permit interactions that you initiate between our site and third-party websites or services, including third-party social networks (collectively, "Social Features"). For example, you may be able to "like" or "share" content from our Services on other websites or services, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Google, and LinkedIn. By choosing to "like" or "share" information from our Services through these services, you should review the privacy policy of that service.</p>

								<p>If you use Social Features on our Services or access our Services from Social Features, both YourPreferredTVDealer and the social media services that operate those Social Features may have access to certain information about you and your use of both our site and theirs. If you are a member of a social media site and logged in, the interfaces configured on our Services may allow the social media site to connect your site visit and browsing behaviour to the personal data held on your social media site. We may use this information on an aggregate basis to place ads that are based on your interests on these social media sites. These practises are governed by the privacy statements of these social networking sites, and you are advised to review these separately.</p>

								<p>In addition, we may request your permission to: a) access and collect information available from your social networking account; and b) post information to your friends on your behalf. When you connect your social networking service with your YourPreferredTVDealer account, you authorise us to access certain information about you from your social networking service to provide content and services, including to help us tailor our communications to you and to develop rich online content and services across the Services. The information we may access from your social networking services is governed by the privacy policies and settings of those third-party services.</p>

								<p>The information collected and stored by the social media sites remains subject to those sites’ privacy practises, including whether they continue to disclose information to us, the types of information shared, and your choices regarding what is visible to others on those third-party websites or services.</p>

								<h4 class="s-24 w-700">TV and Audio Control Services</h4>

								<p>We have partnered with certain third-party companies that offer TV and audio control services to enhance your video content viewing experience. For example, you can use third-party apps and audio control services, such as the Apple TV App or Siri, to search, recommend, or access video content on the Services. These apps and audio control services may be able to collect and store information about you, including about your video viewing activities on the Services. By using your Services account with a third-party TV app or audio control service, you consent to the disclosure of information about you, including the video content that you have watched on the Services. You can limit how third-party TV apps or audio control services collect and store information about your video content viewing by visiting the third-party app’s privacy settings. For example, the Apple TV App allows you to discontinue the collection and storage of your video content viewing information by visiting the Apple TV App Settings page and choosing the "Remove and Clear Play History" option. Click here to learn more about the Apple TV and audio control services privacy policies.</p>

								<h4 class="s-24 w-700">Manage Your Information</h4>

								<p>You can make the following choices using our online form here regarding your Personal Information:</p>

								<p>Access to Your Personal Information. You may request access to your Personal Information that we collect on our own behalf. If required by law, upon request, we will grant you reasonable access to the Personal Information that we have about you.</p>

								<p>Changes to Your Personal Information We rely on you to update and correct your Personal Information. Note that we may keep historical information in our backup files as permitted by law. If our Services do not permit you to update or correct certain information, contact us at the address described below. If we are processing your Personal Information on behalf of one of our clients, we will respond that we are operating as a Service Provider and are unable to act on your request.</p>

								<p>Deletion of Your Personal Information. When we collect information on our own behalf, we typically retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. You may, however, request information about how long we keep a specific type of information or request that we delete your Personal Information by contacting us at the address described below. If required by law, we will grant a request to delete information, but you should note that in some situations we must keep your Personal Information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, or for another one of our business purposes. If we are processing your Personal Information on behalf of one of our clients, we will respond that we are operating as a Service Provider and are unable to act on your request.</p>

								<p>Objection to Certain Processing. When we process information on our own behalf, you may object to our use of your Personal Information by contacting us at the address described below. For example, California residents may be entitled to object to, or opt-out of, having their Personal Information sold to third parties. If you are a California resident and would like to opt out of having your information sold, please visit the following link: Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information. We do not discriminate against California consumers who exercise any of their rights described in this policy.</p>

								<p>Revocation of Consent If you revoke your consent for the processing of Personal Information, then we may no longer be able to provide you with services. In some cases, we may limit or deny your request to revoke consent if the law permits or requires us to do so or if we are unable to adequately verify your identity. You may revoke consent to processing (where such processing is based on consent) by contacting us at the address described below.</p>

								<p>As required by law, we will require you to prove your identity for us to process your request. Depending on your request, we will require you to provide your name, phone number, and email address at the minimum. We may require additional information to verify your identity, depending on the sensitivity of the personal information related to your request.</p>

								<p>If you do not want to make requests for access, deletion, or Do Not Sell using our online form, you may contact us at sales@yourpreferredtvdealer.com </p>
								
								<p>An authorised agent may make any of the requests above by using our online form or contacting us as noted above.</p>

								<p>We will make an appeal form available in our response to you if you are not satisfied with our decision on your request.</p>

								<h4 class="s-24 w-700">You can also make the following choices regarding communications preferences:</h4>

								<p>Promotional Emails. You may choose to provide us with your email address for the purpose of allowing us to deliver newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials to you, as well as targeted offers from third parties. You can stop receiving promotional emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in the emails that you receive. If you decide not to receive promotional emails, we may still send you service-related communications.</p>

								<p>Promotional Mailings. If at any time you do not want to receive offers and/or circulars from us, you can remove yourself from our mailing lists by emailing us (our contact information is below) with "NO SNAIL MAIL" in the subject line along with your name, address, and zip code. Please note that our mailings are prepared in advance of being sent. Although we will remove your name from our mailing list after receiving your request, you may still receive mailings from us that were initiated prior to your name being removed.</p>

								<p>Text Messages and Push notifications If you receive a text message from us that contains promotional information, you can opt out of receiving future text messages by replying "STOP" or "UNSUBSCRIBE." You control on your device whether you receive push notifications.</p>

								<p>Cookies. You can review your settings by clicking the "cookie settings" link in the footer of most sites. Our Cookie Policy also provides more information on settings you can control.</p>

								<h4 class="s-24 w-700">How We Protect Personal Information</h4>

								<p>No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is fully secure. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Information from unauthorised access, use, or disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information. If we are required by law to inform you of a breach of your Personal Information, we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.</p>

								<p>Some of our websites permit you to create an account. When you do, you will be prompted to create a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else who has obtained your password or device, whether such access or use has been authorised by you. You should notify us of any unauthorised use of your password or account.</p>
